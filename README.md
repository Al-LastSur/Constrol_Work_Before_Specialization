# Constrol_Work_Before_Specialization
Perform a task for Control Quiz in 2024. Sent after the Introductory part of education at GeekBrains. Hopefully checked before continuing the Specialized Part of Education

The Task is executed by Yastrebov Alex, Astana, Kazakhstan.

All the details on the task you can get from Task_Description. md file.

Here we will state the stages of preparation and execution of the task described inside the abovementioned file.

## The Main Task 

Write down the code which will form up a new array out of the existing array of string type, the length of which is less or equal to 3 symbols. The initial array might be read from keyboard or sset at the beginning of executing the algorithm. During solution it is not recommended to use collections, better use the arrays only.

# Possible Task Solution is brief explanation

## What do we have at the beginning?

Introduced array of string type. Alternatevely the array might be read from console.

## The Solution process

1. Calculate the amount of symbols of each element of initial array
>Comment : CalculateStringLength method applied successfully. The program identifies the amount of symbols in each element of string array
2. identify if the element has less or equal to 3 elements in itself
> Comment: alculateSizeFinalArray method identifies the amount of elemens in an array corresponding to the condition of 3 or less symbols in it and returns the amount of such elements in the array
3. Create a new empty array
4. Copy the content of the initial element to new array element
5. Print array to console

## What do we have at the  End?

The array formed of the elements of initial array corresponding to the Task requirements.
