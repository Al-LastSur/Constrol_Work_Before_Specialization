The Task is algorithmically is not so diffiluct, however for total слусл-up of the executed work it is necessary:
1. To create a repo at GitHub
2. to draw block-chain of the algorithm (it's allowed to describe block-chain of the basic content part, if you place it as a eparate method)
3. To attach the repo with formulated text description of the Task (README.md file)
4. To write the code solving the task being set.
5. Use version control during your work on the project (all the job shouldn't be executed in one commit, as minimum the stages 2,3,and 4 must be allocated inside the different commits)

The task: Write down the code which will form up a new array out of the existing array of string type, the length of which is less or equal to 3 symbols. The initial array might be read from keyboard or sset at the beginning of executing the algorithm. During solution it is not recommended to use collections, better use the arrays only.
